        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Alfaiz Alafi Luthfie, a UI/UX Designer and front end web developer. Here I will share the results of my design work related to the case study "Citra Katering (Citra)".</p>

        <h2>2. Studi Kasus</h2>
        <img src="img/jakarta.jpg" alt="jakarta" class="mb-3" width="100%">
        <p>Greater Jakarta has great potential in the type of business providing food and drinks which is equipped with equipment and supplies for the manufacturing, storage and serving process, then served at the location desired by the customer or what is known as catering services. The catering service business has a variety of needs, including catering services for office events, home events, wedding catering, rice boxes, coffee breaks, snack boxes and so on. The offline catering service business process has many obstacles such as fraud, unsatisfactory service and inefficiency. For this reason, I created an application design "Citra Catering Online" which can solve this problem.</p>

      <!-- Executive Summary -->
      <section class="container executive-summary">
        <h2>3. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In this project, a system will be designed, namely an online food catering ordering application, which is an information system that aims to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the food catering ordering process, especially in the Jakarta area and surrounding cities.</p>
        <p>Work on this information system project was carried out in accordance with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology, namely the Agile methodology which is a software development approach that is flexible and adaptable and is incrementally iterative. With this method, projects are made more flexible to changing needs and users can see project results earlier during the development process</p>

        <p>The purpose of making the design is as follows :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aims to create an online application for ordering food catering in the Jakarta City area and its surroundings</li>
          <li>Designed to make it easier for users to order food catering</li>

      <!-- Wireframe -->
      <section class="container wireframe">
        <h2>7. Wireframe</h2>
        <p>A wireframe is a simple visual representation of a user interface or web page depicted in the form of lines, basic geometric shapes, and text. Wireframes usually don't have colors, images, or other design elements. It aims to highlight the structure and layout of the main elements of an interface without the distraction of visual design.</p>

        <p>In the context of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, high fidelity refers to a prototype or design that approximates or accurately reflects the actual appearance and interactions of the final product. The results of high fidelity are:</p>
